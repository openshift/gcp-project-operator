# Info

The gcp project operator is reponsible for creating projects and service accounts in GCP and storing the credentials in a secret.

## Workflow

- The operator would watch clusterdeployments in all namespaces.
- Operator would check that the clusterdeployment’s labels “api.openshift.com/managed = true” and “hive.openshift.io/cluster-platform = gcp"
  - If both labels are as expected and clusterdeployment field “Spec.Installed = false”
    - The operator will create a project for the cluster from the name provided in
“Spec.Platform.GCP.ProjectID” in the region provided by "Spec.Platform.GCP.Region"
    - The operator will then enable the required APIs.
    - The operator will set quotas as required
    - The operator will then create a service account for the operator and key
    - The operator will create a secret called gcp
    - The operator will add a finalizer to the clusterdeployment
  - If both labels are as expected and the clusterdeployment field “Spec.Installed = true” and the clusterdeployment is attempted to be deleted.
    - The operator will delete the service account and project
    - The operator will remove the finalizer

## Requirements

- OCM will provide a clusterdeployment with the following
  - An agreed upon secret name in "Spec.PlatformSecrets.GCP.Credentials.Name" now it is using name **_gcp_**
  - Unique name in projectID “Spec.Platform.GCP.ProjectID”
  - Supported region in “Spec.Platform.GCP.Region”
  - Ssh Key in the clusterdeployment namesapcew with the clusterdeployment  "Spec.SshKey.Name" filled out
-- Service account credentials with permissions to create projects, service accounts, and service account keys  in the operator namespace _**gcp-project-operator**_

# Deployment

## Building

Just run `make`.

## Local Dev

### Prerequisites

* Typically you'll want to use [CRC](https://github.com/code-ready/crc/), though it's fine if you're running OpenShift another way.
* You need to have [the operator-sdk binary](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases) in your `$PATH`.

### Load Hive CRDS

For gcp-project-operator to work, the cluster needs to have CRDs from [Hive](https://github.com/openshift/hive) present in the system.

Note: the `git clone` below *isn't* using the `master` branch.

```
git clone --branch v1alpha1 https://github.com/openshift/hive
for crd in hive/config/crds/hive_v1alpha1_*.yaml; do (set -x; oc apply -f $crd); done
```

### Start operator locally

```
oc new-project gcp-project-operator
oc apply -f deploy/crds/gcp_v1alpha1_projectclaim_crd.yaml
oc apply -f deploy/crds/gcp_v1alpha1_projectreference_crd.yaml

operator-sdk run --local --namespace gcp-project-operator
```

If everything went ok, you should see some startup logs from the operator in your terminal window.

There are example CRs in `deploy/crds/` you might want to use to see how the operator reacts to their presence (and absence if you delete them).


## Remote

### Pushing Image To quay

If you have permissions to push to quay.io/razevedo/gcp-project-operator. You can use the following commands to push the latest code

```
podman build . -f build/Dockerfile -t quay.io/razevedo/gcp-project-operator

podman push quay.io/razevedo/gcp-project-operator
```

### Deploying code

Currently it is being deployed using image 'quay.io/razevedo/gcp-project-operator' Update deploy/operator.yaml with image you would like deployed.

```
oc apply -f deploy/cluster_role_binding.yaml
oc apply -f deploy/cluster_role.yaml
oc apply -f deploy/service_account.yaml
oc apply -f deploy/operator.yaml
```

If you need to update to lastest image pushed to quay repo

```
oc scale deployment gcp-project-operator -n gcp-project-operator --replicas=0

oc scale deployment gcp-project-operator -n gcp-project-operator --replicas=1
```

## GCP secret creation

```bash
export GCPSA_NAME=gcp-account-operator
export GCP_ORG_NAME=osd-management
# ServiceDelivery org ID
export GCP_ROOT_ORG_NAME=240634451310

gcloud beta iam service-accounts create $GCPSA_NAME \
    --description "$GCPSA_NAME" \
    --display-name "$GCPSA_NAME"

# TODO: this does not work due perm error
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $GCP_ROOT_ORG_NAME \
  --member serviceAccount:$GCPSA_NAME@$GCP_ORG_NAME.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/owner --role roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator \
  --role roles/resourcemanager.folderAdmin

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
  --iam-account $GCPSA_NAME@$GCP_ORG_NAME.iam.gserviceaccount.com


kubectl create secret generic gcp-project-operator --from-file=key.json=secrets/key.json -n gcp-project-operator

```

## GCP Operator configmap creation

```bash
export ORGPARENTFOLDERID="12345678" # Google Cloud organization Parent Folder ID
export BILLINGACCOUNT="" # obtain billing ID from https://console.cloud.google.com/billing

kubectl create configmap gcp-project-operator --from-literal orgParentFolderID=$ORGPARENTFOLDERID --from-literal billingaccount=$BILLINGACCOUNT -n gcp-project-operator

```

# TODO
-  Creation of project for the cluster
  - Some of this code is mocked out but not tested since we do not have a test org yet.
- Enabling the required APIs.
    - Compute Engine API (`compute.googleapis.com`)
    - Google Cloud APIs (`cloudapis.googleapis.com`)
    - Cloud Resource Manager API (`cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`)
    - Google DNS API (`dns.googleapis.com`)
    - Identity and Access Management (IAM) API (`iam.googleapis.com`)

    - Service Usage API (`serviceusage.googleapis.com`)
    - Google Cloud Storage JSON API (`storage-api.googleapis.com`)
    - Cloud Storage (`storage-component.googleapis.com`)
- Setting required quotas
- Enabling Billing
- Adding finalizer to the clusterdeployment
- Cleaning up when clusterdeployment is removed
- Credential Rotation
